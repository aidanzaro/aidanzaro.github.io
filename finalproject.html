        <h1> Welcome to my Final Project</h1>
       <p>
          This project is a game which is based off of Rock, Paper, Scissors. In this case it is Rock, Star, Heart with the same rules. 
          You click on one of the named buttons on the first level and the the computer will make it's choice of rock, star or heart. Star is the same as paper
          and heart is the same as scissors. If you win you will move onto the next level and get a win message, if you lose you will be brought to a new screen 
          and be told to return to the beginning. If you tie you keep playing the level until you win or lose. After beating both levels you will be brought to a 
          winning game screen and the game is over.
